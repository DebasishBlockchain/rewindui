## Installation

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@rewind-ui/core';
```

When you change a source file, Contentlayer automatically updates the content cache, which prompts Next.js to reload the content on screen. Cool!!

```tsx
<Accordion defaultItem="item-1">
  <Accordion.Item anchor="item-1">
    <Accordion.Header>Header</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>Body</Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>

  <Accordion.Item anchor="item-2">
    <Accordion.Header>Header</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>Body</Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>

  <Accordion.Item anchor="item-3">
    <Accordion.Header>Header</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>Body</Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```
