Ena-UI is designed specifically for developers who work with React and tailwindcss. It utilizes powerful libraries such as class-variance-authority (cva) and floating-ui to provide a seamless user experience.

Our library was initially created to solve our own personal problems when building React projects on top of tailwindcss. We found ourselves repeatedly implementing the same reusable components, which was both time-consuming and inefficient.

To address this issue, we developed a library that simplifies the process of creating customizable components. Users can configure the appearance of each component by specifying parameters like size, color, and tone, or by selecting a pre-defined variant like primary or secondary.

Each variant is a pre-defined set of parameters that can be customized by the end user to suit their specific needs. Both styles and variants can be easily re-defined to match the desired aesthetic. We hope that our library will help streamline your development process and improve your overall user experience.

We made sure to follow the WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) guidelines, which means that our components are built to be easy to use for everyone - regardless of any disabilities.
